# PowerBI_Competitor-analysis-case-study
We will apply the concepts of ETL and visualization. 
Through Power BI and Power Query Editor, we will work on the development of a complete Power BI report starting from the data integration from multiple sources, 
data transformation, modeling, and then visualization. 
We will carry out a sales and market share analysis, focusing not only on the company's performance internally, 
reflecting on how well the products sell, but also externally analyzing how well they are doing against competing manufacturers.
